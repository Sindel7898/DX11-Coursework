# DirectX 11 Renderer

This project explores and implements advanced graphics rendering techniques using **HLSL (High-Level Shader Language)** in **DirectX 11**. The goal is to create visually stunning effects while optimizing performance for real-time rendering. The project demonstrates proficiency in key areas of computer graphics, including vertex manipulation, tessellation, dynamic lighting, shadows, and post-processing.

Whether you're a graphics enthusiast, a student, or a developer looking to learn advanced DirectX techniques, this project serves as a comprehensive example of modern graphics programming.

## Features

### 1. **Vertex Manipulation**
   - Dynamically modifies vertex positions to achieve effects like **wave simulations** and **terrain deformation** in real time.
   - Enables the creation of interactive and dynamic environments without precomputed animations.

### 2. **Tessellation**
   - Utilizes DirectX 11's tessellation shaders to subdivide models in real time, enhancing surface detail.
   - Ideal for rendering high-fidelity terrains and intricate surfaces while maintaining performance.

### 3. **Geometry Shader Techniques**
   - Implements procedural geometry generation for creating **particle systems** and **volumetric shapes**.
   - Adds depth and immersion to scenes through dynamic visual effects.

### 4. **Lighting and Shadows**
   - Features multiple lighting models, including **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)**, to simulate realistic light interactions.
   - Incorporates **shadow mapping** and other shadow techniques to improve depth perception and realism.

### 5. **Post-Processing Effects**
   - Enhances the final rendered image with effects like:
     - **Bloom**
     - **Tone Mapping**
     - **Color Grading**
     - **Depth-of-Field Blur**
   - Achieves cinematic visuals and allows for fine-tuning of the scene's aesthetic.
